That was frightening!
I was suddenly attacked... Thank you, traveler
What is your name? Ivo, is it?
I see a <> on the back of your left hand.
That is the sign of a HYRULEAN hero!.
That must be why the beasts fled.
I am Impa, nurse to Hyrule's Princess Zelda. 
I am looking for a singer named Nayru.
Will you help me look, Ivo?
I'd feel safer with you nearby.
